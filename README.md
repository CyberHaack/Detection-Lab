# Detection-Lab

## Objective

The objective of the Detection Lab project was to create a secure environment for simulations and detecting cyberattacks. The main goal was to create test telemetry that simulatedÂ actual attack scenarios by ingesting and analyzing logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. The purpose of this practical experience was to broaden understanding of attack patterns, defensive techniques, and network security.

### Skills Learned


- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.


### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
